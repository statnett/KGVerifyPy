= KGValidatePy – Knowledge Graph Validation for Python

:toclevels: 2

== Overview

**KGValidatePy** is a Python library for validating knowledge graphs on top of pySHACL.

It provides DataOps-oriented approched that can support both ModelOps and SchemaOps workflows.

KGValidatePy extends the capabilities of link:https://github.com/RDFLib/pySHACL[pySHACL] and integrates tightly with **KGraphPy**, providing structured validation pipelines for standards-based knowledge graph data, including Common Information Model (CIM) / Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) confomred datasets.

The library is designed to support:

- Constraint validation
- Schema validation
- Reasoning-assisted validation
- Structured validation reporting
- Integration with editing and verification workflows

KGValidatePy builds on top of KGraphPy-based (RDFLib) and pySHACL graph handling while remaining implementation-neutral at the interface level.

== Scope and Focus

KGValidatePy focuses on validation of RDF-based knowledge graphs where:

- RDF is the canonical representation
- Constraints are expressed via SHACL or related mechanisms
- Data quality must be enforced in automated pipelines
- Validation results must be actionable in editing or verification workflows

While CIM / CGMES is the primary initial focus, KGValidatePy is reusable across other standards and profiles, including IEC 61850, BIM/IFC, GeoSPARQL datasets, EU SEMIC profiles, and Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).

== Core Capabilities

KGValidatePy provides:

- SHACL-based constraint validation (via pySHACL)
- Optional reasoning support (RDFS / OWL profiles where applicable)
- Validation of named graphs and dataset-level metadata
- Structured validation reports suitable for:
  - Machine processing
  - Human-readable summaries
  - UI integration (e.g., KGEditPy)

== Extended Validation Support

In addition to SHACL validation, KGValidatePy may support:

- Schema-level validation where RDF is the canonical content:
  - XML Schema (XSD) for interchange constraints
  - JSON Schema for derived artefacts
  - Avro schema validation for event or stream representations
- Validation of packaging conventions (e.g., header consistency)
- DifferenceSet validation in change-oriented workflows

These extensions are designed to complement, not replace, SHACL-based validation.

== Relationship to Other Libraries

KGValidatePy is intentionally composable:

- **KGraphPy** provides graph handling and packaging support
- **pySHACL** provides the SHACL validation engine
- **LinkML** may provide schema definitions and generated artefacts
- **KGVerifyPy** may use validation results as part of executable verification workflows
- **KGEditPy** may present validation findings for human correction

KGValidatePy does not reimplement SHACL validation logic; it orchestrates and extends it for DataOps (including SchemaOps and ModelOps) use cases.

== Licensing

KGValidatePy is released under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**.

This permits open use, modification, and redistribution in research, public sector, and commercial contexts under the terms of the license.

== Accreditation

KGValidatePy builds upon the excellent work of the **pySHACL** project and its contributors.

- pySHACL: https://github.com/RDFLib/pySHACL

We explicitly acknowledge the RDFLib and pySHACL communities for providing the foundational SHACL validation capabilities that make this library possible.

KGValidatePy extends these capabilities for standards-based DataOps workflows but remains an independent open-source project.
